Local governments across Tampa Bay have teamed up to improve recycling efforts in the region in this award-winning campaign. Recycling rules vary by jurisdiction based on collection and processing capabilities, so please check with your local recycling service provider to ensure you are recycling correctly and helping our region avoid the common challenge of contamination - attempting to recycle soiled items or materials our programs don't accept.
