Local governments across Tampa Bay have teamed up to improve recycling efforts in the region. Recycling rules vary by jurisdiction based on collection and processing capabilities so please check with your local recycling service provider to ensure you are recycling correctly and helping our region avoid the common challenge of contamination - attempting to recycle soiled items or materials our programs don’t accept.

Join the social media conversation, share recycling tips, and ask questions by using **#TampaBayRecycles**

> Whether you have been recycling for decades or just started, it’s worth taking a second look to make sure you are recycling correctly. Recycling technology and processes change over time, so recycling program rules change, too.
