## Keep Plastic Bags Out of Recycling

Remember to keep your recyclables clean, dry, and un-bagged when depositing them into recycling carts or local drop-off centers. Bagged recyclables aren’t recycled because they can’t be sorted by the recycling equipment.

Utilizing reusable bags is more eco-friendly than getting single-use plastic bags when shopping. Plastic bags can only be recycled at participating retailers. If you can’t return bags to store locations, it’s okay to throw them away in the garbage since all four governments use Waste-to-Energy facilities for trash disposal – turning garbage into renewable electricity.
