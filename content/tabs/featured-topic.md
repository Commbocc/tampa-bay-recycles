## Keep Recycling Loose

Putting recyclables in plastic bags can ruin your recycling efforts. The automated equipment used to sort recyclables at the recycling processing facilities cannot remove items from plastic bags. This means bagged recyclables get set aside as trash.

Bagged items are dangerous for workers to open, since they often include broken glass or other sharp objects, and if the contents are trash it can ruin other recyclables. Plastic bags also tangle up the sorting equipment causing damage, work slowdowns, and hazards for workers.

To make the most of your recycling efforts, only place loose recyclable items in the curbside collection cart, drop off recycling container, or community collection bin. If you gather recyclables in a plastic bag, please empty the items into the recycling container and trash the bag or reuse it.
