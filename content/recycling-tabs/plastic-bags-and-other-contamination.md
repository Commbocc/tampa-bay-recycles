Plastic Bags & Bagged Items

Plastic bags and bagged items don’t belong in curbside recycling or drop-off programs. Plastic bags get tangled in recycling sorting equipment and can shut down the recycling facility, which puts workers at risk to remove them.

Plastic bags and film can be recycled at participating stores. If you cannot reuse plastic bags or return them to stores, place them in the garbage.

Utilizing reusable bags is more eco-friendly than getting single-use plastic bags when shopping. Plastic bags can only be recycled at participating retailers. If you can't return bags to store locations, it's okay to throw them away in the garbage since all four governments use Waste-to-Energy facilities for trash disposal – turning garbage into renewable electricity.

#What is Recycling Contamination?

Contamination happens when unaccepted items are placed in the recycling bin. Contamination is any item not accepted in your recycling program, such as plastic bags and bagged recycling, foam packaging products, and food waste. When too many wrong items are collected, equipment can be damaged or entire truckloads of recyclables can be disposed of, raising recycling costs for everyone. When in doubt, leave it out!
