Recycling program guidelines can be slightly different depending on where you work, live, and play in Tampa Bay. It's important you know before you throw. Check with your local community to see what is accepted in your recycling program. Remember to keep accepted recyclables clean, dry, and not bagged before placing them in recycling carts or at drop-off centers.
