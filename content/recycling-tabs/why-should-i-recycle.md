## Why Should I Recycle?

As Tampa Bay continues to grow, so does the amount of waste generated. Due to the limited landfill disposal capacity and stress on the waste-to-energy facilities, reducing waste and recycling is more important than ever. By recycling, you help Tampa Bay communities save resources and energy, support local economies, and protect the environment.

## Recycling Saves Natural Resources

Recycling is the process of transforming materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash and turning them into new products, avoiding resource extraction from the environment. Glass bottles can be recycled into fiberglass and new containers; aluminum cans can be recycled into new beverage cans; and paper can be recycled into over 5,000 products, including writing paper, paper towels, coffee filters, hospital gowns, egg cartons, and more.

Aluminum cans are 100% recyclable and there is no limit to how many times they can be recycled. Around 75% of the aluminum made is still in circulation.

## Recycling Saves Energy

Recycling high-density polyethylene or HDPE bottles and jugs (examples of this plastic are milk, water, and laundry detergent bottles and jugs) [reduces total energy consumption by 88%](https://plasticsrecycling.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2018-APR-LCI-report.pdf){target="_blank"} compared to making the items from virgin materials.

## Recycling is Supported by the State of Florida

In 2008, the Florida Legislature set a recycling goal of 75% by 2020 for Florida counties. The state did not meet this goal. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection will be developing a new state recycling goal and measurement framework. Florida counties are responsible for reporting their recycling rate annually, including the tons recycled by residents and businesses.

## Recycling Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases (GHGs). The GHGs created from human activities have been the most significant driver of observed [climate change](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#climate){target="_blank"} since the mid-1900s, according to the EPA. Three [notable GHGs](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases){target="_blank"} include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).

The best way to reduce GHGs is to reduce what you use, reducing the amount of waste generated. For example, opting for less-packaged goods, using durable and reusable products over single-use products, and shopping secondhand are great ways to reduce the GHGs emitted during the manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of new materials.

Imagine purchasing a plastic water bottle from the grocery store today. How was that water bottle created? How did it get to you? What will you do with it after it’s no longer of use to you? Each step of the process – from the extraction of oil to create the plastic, the transportation of those materials by gasoline-powered planes, ships, and vehicles, the energy that the manufacturing process entails, and its end-of-life fate – will determine how many GHGs are emitted into the atmosphere.
