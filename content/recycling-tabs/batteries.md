## Batteries

Because rechargeable and lithium batteries can explode when compressed and start a fire, they should be properly disposed of at drop-off locations. Proper disposal of these batteries helps keep employees safe and benefits the environment.

Alkaline batteries including A, AA, AAA, C, D, and 9-volt batteries can be disposed of in curbside trash carts but should never be placed in recycling carts.

Check your local provider for battery disposal guidelines and locations:
