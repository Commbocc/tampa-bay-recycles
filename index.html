            Local governments across Tampa Bay have teamed up to improve recycling efforts in the region in this
            award-winning campaign. Recycling rules vary by
            jurisdiction based on collection and processing capabilities, so
            please check with your local recycling service provider to ensure
            you are recycling correctly and helping our region avoid the
            common challenge of contamination - attempting to recycle soiled
            items or materials our programs don't accept.

            Whether you have been recycling for decades or just started, it's

                Recycling program guidelines can be slightly different depending on where you work, live, and play in
                Tampa Bay. It's important you know before you throw. Check with your local community to see what is
                accepted in your recycling program. Remember to keep accepted recyclables clean, dry, and not bagged
                before placing them in recycling carts or at drop-off centers.

              <h3>Plastic Bags & Bagged Items</h3>

              <p>Plastic bags and bagged items don’t belong in curbside recycling or drop-off programs. Plastic bags get
                tangled in recycling sorting equipment and can shut down the recycling facility, which puts workers at
                risk to remove them.<br />
              </p>

              <p>Plastic bags and film can be recycled at participating stores. If you cannot reuse plastic bags or
                return them to stores, place them in the garbage.<br />
              </p>

              <p>Utilizing reusable bags is more eco-friendly than getting
                single-use plastic bags when shopping. Plastic bags can only
                be recycled at participating retailers. If you can't return
                bags to store locations, it's okay to throw them away in the
                garbage since all four governments use Waste-to-Energy
                facilities for trash disposal – turning garbage into renewable
                electricity.<br />
              </p>

              <h3>What is Recycling Contamination?</h3>

              <p>Contamination happens when unaccepted items are placed in the recycling bin. Contamination is any item
                not accepted in your recycling program, such as plastic bags and bagged recycling, foam packaging
                products, and food waste. When too many wrong items are collected, equipment can be damaged or entire
                truckloads of recyclables can be disposed of, raising recycling costs for everyone. When in doubt, leave
                it out!<br />

              <h3>Batteries</h3>

              <p>Because rechargeable and lithium batteries can explode when compressed and start a fire, they should be
                properly disposed of at drop-off locations. Proper disposal of these batteries helps keep employees safe
                and benefits the environment.<br />
              </p>

              <p>Alkaline batteries including A, AA, AAA, C, D, and 9-volt batteries can be disposed of in curbside
                trash carts but should never be placed in recycling carts.<br />

              <p>Check your local provider for battery disposal guidelines and locations:<br />

            <h3>Why Should I Recycle?</h3>

            <p>
              As Tampa Bay continues to grow, so does the amount of waste generated. Due to the limited landfill
              disposal capacity and stress on the waste-to-energy facilities, reducing waste and recycling is more
              important than ever. By recycling, you help Tampa Bay communities save resources and energy, support
              local economies, and protect the environment.
            </p>

            <h3>Recycling Saves Natural Resources</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Recycling is the process of transforming materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash
                and turning them into new products, avoiding resource extraction from the environment. Glass bottles
                can be recycled into fiberglass and new containers; aluminum cans can be recycled into new beverage
                cans; and paper can be recycled into over 5,000 products, including writing paper, paper towels,
                coffee filters, hospital gowns, egg cartons, and more. </li>

              <li>Aluminum cans are 100% recyclable and there is no limit to how many times they can be recycled.
                Around 75% of the aluminum made is still in circulation.</li>

              <li><a href="https://napcor.com/recycling/pet-end-products/" target="_blank">Recycled water bottles made
                  from PET plastic</a> can be used to make fiber for clothing and carpets, food and non-food bottles,
                take-out containers, and fill for furnishings. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recycling Saves Energy</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Recycling high-density polyethylene or HDPE bottles and jugs (examples of this plastic are milk,
                water, and laundry detergent bottles and jugs) <a
                  href="https://plasticsrecycling.org/images/library/2018-APR-LCI-report.pdf" target="_blank">reduces
                  total energy
                  consumption by 88%</a> compared to
                making the items from virgin materials. </li>

              <li><a href="https://www.aluminum.org/Recycling" target="_blank">Recycling aluminum cans</a> saves 95%
                of the energy that is needed to make aluminum from its virgin source. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recycling is Supported by the State of Florida</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>In 2008, the Florida Legislature set a recycling goal of 75% by 2020 for Florida counties. The
                state did not meet this goal. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection will be developing a
                new state recycling goal and measurement framework. Florida counties are responsible for reporting
                their recycling rate annually, including the tons recycled by residents and businesses. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recycling Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases (GHGs). The GHGs created from
                human activities have been the most significant driver of observed <a
                  href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/greenhouse-gases" target="_blank">climate change</a>
                since the mid-1900s,
                according to the EPA. Three <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases"
                  target="_blank">notable GHGs</a> include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
                oxide (N2O).</li>

              <li>The best way to reduce GHGs is to reduce what you use, reducing the amount of waste generated. For
                example, opting for less-packaged goods, using durable and reusable products over single-use products,
                and shopping secondhand are great ways to reduce the GHGs emitted during the manufacturing,
                transportation, and disposal of new materials.</li>

              <li>Imagine purchasing a plastic water bottle from the grocery store today. How was that water bottle
                created? How did it get to you? What will you do with it after it’s no longer of use to you? Each step
                of the process – from the extraction of oil to create the plastic, the transportation of those
                materials by gasoline-powered planes, ships, and vehicles, the energy that the manufacturing process
                entails, and its end-of-life fate – will determine how many GHGs are emitted into the atmosphere.</li>
