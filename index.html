              Local governments across Tampa Bay have teamed up to improve
              recycling efforts in the region. Recycling rules vary by
              jurisdiction based on collection and processing capabilities so
              please check with your local recycling service provider to ensure
              you are recycling correctly and helping our region avoid the
              common challenge of contamination - attempting to recycle soiled
              items or materials our programs don't accept.

                <h3>Keep Recycling Loose</h3>
                <p>
                  Putting recyclables in plastic bags can ruin your recycling
                  efforts. The automated equipment used to sort recyclables at
                  the recycling processing facilities cannot remove items from
                  plastic bags. This means bagged recyclables get set aside as
                  trash.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Bagged items are dangerous for workers to open, since they
                  often include broken glass or other sharp objects, and if the
                  contents are trash it can ruin other recyclables. Plastic bags
                  also tangle up the sorting equipment causing damage, work
                  slowdowns, and hazards for workers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To make the most of your recycling efforts, only place loose
                  recyclable items in the curbside collection cart, drop off
                  recycling container, or community collection bin. If you
                  gather recyclables in a plastic bag, please empty the items
                  into the recycling container and trash the bag or reuse it.
                </p>

                <h3>Trash the Tanglers</h3>

                <p>
                  Items such as plastic bags, cords, wires, tarps and hoses jam
                  and damage sorting equipment used for recycling processing.
                  Not only can this damage the equipment, but workers must
                  manually remove them, a difficult, dirty, and potentially
                  dangerous task.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cords, wires, tarps, chains, rope, and hoses of any type
                  should always be discarded in your trash cart, never your
                  recycling cart. The same applies to other common tanglers like
                  the plastic film used on cases of water bottles, clothing
                  hangers, and textiles, such as clothing, towels, or linens.
                  Check with your local dry cleaner for options to recycle wire
                  clothing hangers and consider donating lightly worn clothing
                  to local charities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tanglers also include the plastic bags you may have used to
                  gather and store your recyclables. Throw garbage bags in the
                  trash and place your recyclables in the cart loose. Recycle
                  single-use plastic bags in special bins at your local grocery
                  or big box store. If you can't return bags to store locations,
                  it's okay to discard them in your trash cart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trash these tanglers to help us keep our recycling equipment
                  working to recycle items that we can successfully recover.

                <h3>Keep Plastic Bags Out of Recycling</h3>
                <p>
                  Remember to keep your recyclables clean, dry, and un-bagged
                  when depositing them into recycling carts or local drop-off
                  centers. &nbsp;Bagged recyclables aren't recycled because they
                  can't be sorted by the recycling equipment.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  Utilizing reusable bags is more eco-friendly than getting
                  single-use plastic bags when shopping. Plastic bags can only
                  be recycled at participating retailers. If you can't return
                  bags to store locations, it's okay to throw them away in the
                  garbage since all four governments use Waste-to-Energy
                  facilities for trash disposal – turning garbage into renewable
                  electricity.<br />

                <p>
                  If you are unsure about whether an item is recyclable, visit
                  your municipal recycling webpage below to verify if it can be
                  recycled in your program. &nbsp;Remember “when in doubt, throw
                  it out” as local recycling programs are designed to recover
                  typical household plastic, glass and metal containers, and dry
                  paper and cardboard. Not all plastics and metals can be
                  recycled in local programs.

                <h3>What is Recycling Contamination?</h3>
                <p>
                  Contamination happens when residents attempt to recycle items
                  that can't be recovered in our single-stream residential
                  recycling programs. Items such as plastic bags, cords, wires,
                  tarps, and hoses jam and damage sorting equipment. Trash these
                  tanglers to help us keep our recycling equipment working to
                  recycle items that we can successfully recover.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unrinsed food containers or soiled paper can't be recovered
                  and contaminate the other clean, quality recyclables. Items,
                  such as electronics or clothing, also can't be recovered in
                  single-stream residential drop-off or curbside collection
                  programs, but may be recyclable at specific locations and
                  other collection programs within the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contamination increases recycling costs and degrades the
                  quality of materials, reducing the ability of the materials to
                  be recycled. Help contribute to the success of recycling
                  programs by reviewing what can and cannot be recycled by
                  visiting your local government's recycling webpage.
