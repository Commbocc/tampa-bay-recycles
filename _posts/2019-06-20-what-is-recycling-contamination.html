    <h3>What is Recycling Contamination?</h3>
    <p>Contamination happens when residents attempt to recycle items that can’t be recovered in our single-stream residential recycling programs. Items such as plastic bags, cords, wires, tarps, and hoses jam and damage sorting equipment. Trash these tanglers to help us keep our recycling equipment working to recycle items that we can successfully recover.</p>
    <p>Unrinsed food containers or soiled paper can’t be recovered and contaminate the other clean, quality recyclables. Items, such as electronics or clothing, also can’t be recovered in single-stream residential drop-off or curbside collection programs, but may be recyclable at specific locations and other collection programs within the region.</p>
    <p>Contamination increases recycling costs and degrades the quality of materials, reducing the ability of the materials to be recycled. Help contribute to the success of recycling programs by reviewing what can and cannot be recycled by visiting your local government’s recycling webpage.</p>
