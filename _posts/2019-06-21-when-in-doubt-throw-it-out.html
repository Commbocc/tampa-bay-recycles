    <h3>When in Doubt, Throw It Out</h3>
    <p>If you are unsure about whether an item is recyclable, visit your municipal recycling webpage below to verify if it can be recycled in your program. &nbsp;Remember “when in doubt, throw it out” as local recycling programs are designed to recover typical household plastic, glass and metal containers, and dry paper and cardboard. Not all plastics and metals can be recycled in local programs.</p>
